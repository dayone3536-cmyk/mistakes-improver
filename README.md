# mistakes-improver
I made a mistake improver for improving my own python every day because I know consistency builds skill
I learned about saving files and other things in the disk using python by the open() function
This program first asks about your day your mistakes and takes the date and stores it with the open() in many variables and at last calls the variables which will print the the mistake of my day and the lessons i learned
